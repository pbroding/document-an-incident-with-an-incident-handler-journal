<h2>Incident Handler's Journal</h2>
<h4>Welcome to my cybersecurity lab, where I've delved into the art of creating digital evidence documentation with a focus on the 'Incident Handler's Journal.' This journal is a testament to the meticulous record-keeping that plays a pivotal role in incident management and digital forensics.</h4>

<h4>In the realm of cybersecurity, creating a comprehensive incident journal is essential. It's the digital equivalent of a detective's notebook, capturing all the critical details of major incidents that occur in the complex landscape of digital security. The journal acts as a reference point, aiding incident handlers, investigators, and legal authorities in understanding and reconstructing the incident.</h4>

<h4>Two Accessible Formats: To ensure that the knowledge is readily accessible, I've provided the lab report in two user-friendly formatsâ€”Microsoft Word and PDF. This allows you to choose the medium that suits your preferences and makes your exploration of the topic even more engaging.</h4>
